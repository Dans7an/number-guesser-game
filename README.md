This game is all about guessing a random number generated by the computer. It's a guessing game between you and the computer, don't be stumbled by the fact that you
are competing with the same computer that is designating the target number you are supposed to guess. I am sure it's also unaware of the secret number. The person who 
guesses the right number or the number closest to the target number wins the round.
Good luck!👍🏾
